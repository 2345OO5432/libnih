0.2.1  XXXX-XX-XX

	* The --enable-compiler-warnings configure option has been
	  extended to add -Wextra, but turns off a few of the more extreme
	  warnings

	* TEST_FILE_MATCH() added to allow matching of a line in a file
	  against a wildcard string

	* NIH_MUST(), NIH_ZERO() and NIH_SHOULD() now expand to an
	  expression with the value of the expression inside.  This means
	  that the code like the following is now valid:

		ret = NIH_SHOULD (some_function_call ());
		if (ret < 0)
			...

	  This style is preferred to the previous way of doing it (set ret
	  inside the macro call) and the code has been updated.

	* nih_option_parser() fixed to not eat an argument containing a
	  lone dash.

	* nih_error_raise_again() renamed to nih_error_raise_error().

	* Errors are no longer removed from the context when you call
	  nih_error_get(), this means that to clear the error you must free
	  it and it's now a bug to call nih_error_raise_error() to raise
	  it again.

	* nih_option_help() produces slightly different output if the
	  bug reporting address is a URL.

	* The D-Bus binding tool has moved into a separate nih-dbus-tool
	  subdirectory.

	* D-Bus 1.2.4 is now required.

	* pkg-config 0.22 is now required, it probably was anyway but we
	  now explicitly check for it.

	* Dependency on Python for the D-Bus binding tool has been dropped
	  and replaced with a dependency on expat 2.0.0

0.2.0  2009-01-29

	* nih_alloc_set_allocator() is now a macro that casts the function
	  to the right typedef, so such casts are no longer needed

	* nih_alloc() now permits multiple parent references
	  - nih_ref(ptr, parent) creates a new parent reference
	  - nih_unref(ptr, parent) drops a reference and frees if the last
	  - nih_unref_only(ptr, parent) drops a reference without freeing
	  - nih_free() unconditionally frees as it always has
	  - nih_discard() only frees if there are no references

	* nih_local may be added to variable definitions to have the
	  pointer automatically discarded when it goes out of scope, unless
	  it is referenced in the meantime:

		{
			nih_local char *str = NULL;
			str = nih_strdup (NULL, "some string");
			pass_to_func (str);
		}

	* nih_alloc_reparent() has been dropped, it can be replaced with
	  an nih_unref_only()/nih_ref() pair - however many uses of this
	  are no longer necessary and it's worth taking some time to refactor
	  the code.

	* nih_alloc_parent() has changed; it now accepts both an object ptr
	  and a parent and returns TRUE if the object has that parent, if
	  parent is NULL is returns TRUE of the object has any parent.
	  (previously it was used to return _the_ parent).

	* TEST_ALLOC_PARENT() now behaves as nih_alloc_parent(), which means
	  testing for no parent with NULL has the exact opposite behaviour
	  use the new TEST_ALLOC_ORPHAN(ptr) macro instead.

	* nih_str_array_addp() now references the passed pointer, instead
	  of reparenting it.  Calling code should be modified to make sure
	  it either calls nih_discard() or uses nih_local to be safe in case
	  of error.

	* nih_strv_free() has been dropped since it did not match the
	  behaviour of the other functions

	* new NIH_LIST_ITER(iter, type, member) macro to handle the case of
	  an offset head in an iterated structure

	* nih_hash_pointer_new(), nih_hash_pointer_key(),
	  nih_hash_pointer_hash() and nih_hash_pointer_cmp() have been dropped
	  since they did strange things to pointers that probably aren't
	  legal C.

	* nih_config_parse() now reads the file into memory, instead of using
	  mmap().  The API is unchanged, however the errors may be different.

	* The D-Bus bindings have been moved into a separate sub-directory
	  and split out into multiple files.  You will need to update your
	  includes as follows:
	  - NihDBusError and nih_dbus_error_*() are in nih-dbus/dbus_error.h
	  - nih_dbus_connect(), nih_dbus_bus(), nih_dbus_setup() and
	    nih_dbus_server() are in nih-dbus/dbus_connection.h
	  - NihDBusMessage and nih_dbus_message_*() are in
	    nih-dbus/dbus_message.h
	  - NihDBusObject, NihDBusInterface and nih_dbus_object_new() are in
	    nih-dbus/dbus_object.h
	  - NihDBusProxy and nih_dbus_proxy_new() are in nih-dbus/dbus_proxy.h
	  - nih_dbus_path() is now in nih-dbus/dbus_util.h

	* The D-Bus test macros are now in nih-dbus/test_dbus.h

	* nih_dbus_message_new() now exists as a function in its own right

	* Asynchronous method callbacks must take a reference to the
	  NihDBusMessage object they are passed, otherwise it will be freed

	* Reply functions and nih_dbus_message_error() no longer free the
	  message passed in, this is consistent with the above change.

	* libtool 2.2.4 is now required

	* The MIN() and MAX() macros are no longer defined, instead use
	  nih_min() and nih_max() which do not re-evaluate their parameters
	  multiple times.

	* The nih_main_package_string() function has been dropped, instead
	  just access the package_string global set by nih_main_init_full()

0.1.0  2008-10-24
 
	* Initial public release.
