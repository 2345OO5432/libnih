 * Extracts a single token from @file which is stopped when any character
 * in @delim is encountered outside of a quoted string and not escaped
 * using a backslash.
 *
 * @file may be a memory mapped file, in which case @pos should be given
 * as the offset within and @len should be the length of the file as a

 * the start of the token and @len is the difference between the start

 *
 * If you want warnings to be output, pass both @filename and @lineno, which
 * will be used to output the warning message using the usual logging
 * functions.
 *
 * To copy the token into another string, collapsing any newlines and
 * surrounding whitespace to a single space, pass @dest which should be
 * pre-allocated to the right size (obtained by calling this function
 * with NULL).
 *
 * If you also want quotes to be removed and escaped characters to be
 * replaced with the character itself, set @dequote to TRUE.
 *
 * Returns: the length of the token as it was/would be copied into @dest.

 * nih_config_parse_stanza:

 * @lineno: line number,
 * @file: file or string to parse,
 * @len: length of @file,
 * @pos: offset within @file,
 * @stanzas: table of stanza handlers,
 * @data: pointer to pass to stanza handler.
 *
 * Extracts a configuration stanza from @file and calls the handler
 * function for that stanza found in the @stanzas table to handle the
 * rest of the line from thereon in.
 *
 * @file may be a memory mapped file, in which case @pos should be given
 * as the offset within and @len should be the length of the file as a
 * whole.
 *
 * If @pos is given then it will be used as the offset within @file to
 * begin (otherwise the start is assumed), and will be updated to point
 * to @delim or past the end of the file.
 *
 * If @lineno is given it will be incremented each time a new line is
 * discovered in the file.
 *
 * If you want warnings to be output, pass both @filename and @lineno, which
 * will be used to output the warning message using the usual logging
 * functions.
 *
 * A warning is output if no stanza is found, and the position is moved
 * past the end of the line.  This may result in inconsistent parsing.
 *
 * Returns: return value from handler or zero if no handler found.
