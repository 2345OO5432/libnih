 *
 * Raises an error which includes a D-Bus name so that it may be sent as
 * a reply to a method call, the error type is fixed to NIH_DBUS_ERROR.
 *
 * You may use this in D-Bus handlers and return a negative number to
 * automatically have this error returned as the method reply.  It is also
 * useful when mixing D-Bus and libnih function calls in your own methods
 * to return consistent error forms, in which case pass the name and message
 * members of the DBusError structure before freeing it.
