#ifndef NIH_ERROR_H
#define NIH_ERROR_H

/**
 * Many functions in libnih use these functions to report information about
 * errors, those that don't use the ordinary errno mechnism which can
 * also be reported within this framework.
 *
 * Errors are raised as NihError structures, kept globally.  Only one error
 * may be active at any one time, raising an error when another is already
 * raised will emit a warning log message.
 *
 * Errors are raised with the nih_error_raise() or nih_error_raise_printf()
 * functions, passing the error number and a human-readable messages.
 *
 * System errors can be raised with nih_error_raise_system(), and both
 * caught errors and self-allocated errors can be raised with
 * nih_error_raise_error().
 *
 * You then report the error condition through your return value, or some
 * other stack-based method.
 *
 * A higher function that wishes to handle the error calls nih_error_get()
 * to retrieve it, it's an error to do so if you do not know that an error
 * is pending.  This returns the error structure and removes it from the
 * global.
 *
 * Errors may be partitioned using contexts, a new context is pushed with
 * nih_error_push_context(); any errors raised are now stored in this
 * context and any previous raised errors are hidden from view.  The context
 * can be popped again with nih_error_pop_context() any raised errors are
 * lost (with a warning log message) and the previously hidden raised errors
 * are now visible again.
