/**
 * Defines a generic linked list type that may be embedded directly in
 * iterable structures though NihList, or used in a data-pointer manner
 * through NihListEntry.
 *
 * The list will be a doubly-linked circular list.
 *
 * The usual way in which it is used is to have an NihList structure as
 * the "list head", and add other nodes with nih_list_add.  When you
 * iterate, all nodes except the list head are visitied.

 * placed in your own structures to use them as list entries.
 *
 * The list is circular so the @next pointer of the last entry points to
 * the first, and the @prev pointer of the first entry points to the last.
 * An empty list simply has the @prev and @next pointers pointing to itself.

 *
 * This is the cheapest form of iteration, however it is not safe to perform
 * various modifications to the list; most importantly, you must not change
 * the member being iterated in any way, including removing it from the list
 * or freeing it.  If you need to do that, use NIH_LIST_FOREACH_SAFE() instead.
 *

 * Expands to a for statement that iterates over each entry in @list

 * the loop.
 *
 * The iteration is performed safely by placing a cursor node after @iter;
 * this means that any node including @iter can be removed from the list,
 * added to a different list, or entries added before or after it.
 *
 * Note that if you add an entry directly after @iter and wish it to be
 * visited, you would need to use NIH_LIST_FOREACH() instead, as this
 * would be placed before the cursor and thus skipped.
 *
 * Also since the list has an extra node during iteration of a different
 * type, it is expressly not safe to traverse or iterate the list while
 * iterating.  If you need to perform multiple iterations, or reference
 * the next or previous pointers of a node, you must use NIH_LIST_FOREACH().
