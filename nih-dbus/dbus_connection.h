/**
 * This module provides the necessary glue to hook D-Bus connections and
 * servers up to the libnih main loop.
 *
 * Connections obtained from the libdbus library can be hooked up using
 * the nih_dbus_setup() function.  Once called, data on the underlying
 * socket will be sent and received through NihIo and timeouts will be
 * maintained using NihTimer objects.  Each time through the main loop
 * any unhandled messages will be dispatched.
 *
 * The lifetime of connections is also partially managed by the library.
 * Disconnection from the D-Bus server will result in a disconnect handler
 * function being called, and the connection automatically unreferenced
 * and discarded.  A typically well-behaved application might set a timer
 * to attempt to reconnect to the bus.
 *
 * Convenient functions exist to setup connections to servers at specific
 * addresses and to well known bus daemons: nih_dbus_connect() and
 * nih_dbus_bus().  These are equivalent to calling dbus_connection_open()
 * or dbus_bus_get() followed by nih_dbus_setup().
 *
 * Mostly equivalent, anyway.  nih_dbus_bus() explicitly sets the bus
 * connection to NOT result in the application exiting on disconnection,
 * and instead you should cope in your disconnect handler.
 *
 * = Servers =
 *
 * This module may also be used to create D-Bus servers, which is
 * practically impossible to do without main loop integration.
 * nih_dbus_server() creates a server listening on the given address.
 *
 * A connection handler function is called when a new connection is made
 * to the server.  This function generally registers objects or adds
 * filters to the connection and returns TRUE to hook it up to the main
 * loop with the given disconnct handler.  If the function returns FALSE,
 * it is generally dropped.
