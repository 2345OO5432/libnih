 * A method handler function is called for a specific D-Bus method call
 * on @object, available as the @message parameter.  The handler should
 * examine the arguments and send the method reply or an error.
 *
 * While method handlers can be written by hand, it's far more efficient
 * to have them generated automatically.  nih-dbus-tool will generate
 * method handlers that call C functions of appropriate names with
 * ordinary arguments matching the expected types based on the message,
 * and that generate the reply message based on the return arguments.
 *
 * Returns: DBUS_HANDLER_RESULT_HANDLED when the message has been handled
 * and a reply or error sent, DBUS_HANDLER_RESULT_NOT_YET_HANDLED if the
 * handler has declined to handle the message or
 * DBUS_HANDLER_RESULT_NEED_MEMORY if insufficient memory to handle the
