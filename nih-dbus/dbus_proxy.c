/**
 * nih_dbus_proxy_new:
 * @parent: parent object for new proxy,
 * @conn: D-Bus connection to associate with,
 * @name: well-known name of object owner,
 * @path: path of object.
 *
 * Creates a new D-Bus proxy for a remote object @path on the well-known
 * bus name @name.
 *
 * The proxy structure is allocated using nih_alloc() and will contain
 * a reference to the given @conn, you should take care to free a proxy
 * when the @conn is disconnected as this will not happen automatically.
 *
 * If @parent is not NULL, it should be a pointer to another object which
 * will be used as a parent for the returned proxy.  When all parents
 * of the returned proxy are freed, the returned proxy will also be
 * freed.
 *
 * Returns: new NihDBusProxy structure on success, or NULL if
 * insufficient memory.
