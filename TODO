option parser:
- might not want log level stuff by default, likewise help/version

command parser:
- based on option parser, works in form [OPTION...] CMD [OPTION...]
- also switches on argv[0]

timers:
- calendar scheduled timers

file matching functions
common pathnames?


allocator/slab module
restore list_entry code somewhere else

string table:
- as hash, but massively optimised for tables of strings

tree? (binary and n-ary)
- can this be done using NihList for the children nodes of the tree
  a little ineffeficient for binary, though
- need a comparison function
