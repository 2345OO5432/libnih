structures without nih_*_init equivs:
- NihHash
  allocates bins

- NihTimer
  several different allocator functions
  embeds NihList
  added to a linked list

- NihSignal
  several different allocator functions
  embeds NihList
  added to a linked list

- NihChildWatch
  embeds NihList
  added to a linked list

- NihIoWatch
  embeds NihList
  added to a linked list

- NihIoBuffer
  pointers to buffer used as contexts

- NihIoMessage
  allocates buffers and cmsghdr

- NihIo
  allocates buffers and watch

- NihWatch
  allocates path, handles and io

- NihWatchHandle
  allocates path
  embeds NihList
  added to a linked list



structures without destructor, but with own special free function:
- NihIo
  nih_io_close can perform a deferred close

  (nih_io_close could call nih_free, and leave the inside bit to
   nih_io_destroy, the actual free function)

- NihWatch
  nih_watch_free can perform a deferred free

  (nih_watch_?? could call nih_free, and leave the inside bit to
   nih_watch_destroy, the actual free function)



timers:
- calendar scheduled timers

allocator/slab module

string table:
- as hash, but massively optimised for tables of strings
