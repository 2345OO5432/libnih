io:
- there's a couple of tricky tests left to do:
- nih_io_message_recv() with socket types other than PF_UNIX
- nih_io_message_recv() when recv() fails
- nih_io_watcher() with write error and free called

timers:
- calendar scheduled timers

watch:
- inotify already has an IN_ISDIR flag to let us know that we got an event
  for a directory, so we don't really need to stat() it or pass a statbuf
  around; except maybe for compatibility with the walk code.
- handle IN_Q_OVERFLOW in some sane manner, at least log it.

allocator/slab module

string table:
- as hash, but massively optimised for tables of strings
