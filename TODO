make sure all functions that raise an error or return NULL to indicate
  out of memory warn if their result is unused, even if they store it
  somewhere internally
make sure all allocating functions have malloc in their attributes
build a list of "allocating functions" and put it in HACKING (start with
  others); anything calling these needs testing for failure


timers:
- calendar scheduled timers

file matching functions
common pathnames?


allocator/slab module
restore list_entry code somewhere else

string table:
- as hash, but massively optimised for tables of strings

tree? (binary and n-ary)
- can this be done using NihList for the children nodes of the tree
  a little ineffeficient for binary, though
- need a comparison function
