libnih is a light-weight "standard library" of C functions to ease the
development of other libraries and applications.

Its goals are:

 * despite its name, to _not_ reimplement anything found in the
   standard C library or any library normally found in /lib;

 * use standard C types and conventions where appropriate;

 * have a simple and consistent programming interface;

 * be useful to library developers without needing to be exposed in
   the library's API;

 * not hide implementation details or structure contents, we're all
   adults after all.


Usage
-----

The libnih API has not yet been declared stable, and it is not yet
considered suitable for deployment as a shared object shared by many
parts of the system.

Therefore the correct way to use libnih is to copy the source into
your own application or library's tree.  A script (nihify) is provided
to do this for you.

Once you've run this script (from the tree of your own application or
library) you'll need to edit configure.ac and add the following line
after any checks for the compiler (the "Checks for libraries" section
is usually the right place).

	NIH_INIT


Dependencies
------------

In order to query the availability of external libraries, libnih uses
the pkg-config tool:

	* pkg-config 0.22

To build the optional libnih-dbus bindings library you will need the
D-Bus development files for the library itself:

	* D-Bus 1.2.4

To build the D-Bus binding tool you will need the dependencies of the
libnih-dbus library and the development files for the expat XML
parsing library:

	* expat 2.0.0
